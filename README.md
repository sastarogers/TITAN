---

> **WARNING — EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE**
> TITAN is experimental, actively developed software. It can execute shell commands, modify files, access the network, and take autonomous actions on your system. **Use at your own risk.** Think of it less as "software you install" and more as "a very motivated intern with root access." The author and contributors provide this software "as is" without warranty of any kind. By installing or running TITAN, you accept full responsibility for any consequences, including but not limited to data loss, system instability, unintended actions, API charges, or security issues. Always review TITAN's configuration, run it in supervised mode first, and never grant it access to systems or credentials you cannot afford to lose. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the full legal terms.

> **What's New in v2026.10.43 — VRAM Orchestrator + NVIDIA GPU Skills**
>
> TITAN now manages your GPU memory automatically. The new **VRAM Orchestrator** monitors GPU state via `nvidia-smi`, tracks Ollama model loads, and auto-swaps models when services like cuOpt or TTS need VRAM. Time-bounded leases prevent services from hogging GPU memory. Emergency OOM protection unloads models if VRAM drops critically low. All through 3 agent tools (`vram_status`, `vram_acquire`, `vram_release`) and 4 API endpoints.
>
> Also new: **NVIDIA cuOpt** GPU-accelerated optimization (vehicle routing solved in 74ms), **AI-Q** deep research via Nemotron Super NIM, and **OpenShell** K3s-based secure sandboxing. All gated behind `TITAN_NVIDIA=1`.

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** Node.js >= 20, an API key, and a healthy sense of adventure.

### One-Line Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Djtony707/TITAN/main/install.sh | bash
```

This detects your OS, installs Node.js if needed (via nvm), installs `titan-agent` globally, and launches the onboarding wizard.

### Manual Install

```bash
npm install -g titan-agent
titan onboard             # Interactive setup — pick a provider, paste your API key, give TITAN a soul
titan gateway             # Launch Mission Control at http://localhost:48420
```

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d -p 48420:48420 --name titan \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key \
  -v titan-data:/home/titan/.titan \
  ghcr.io/djtony707/titan:latest
```

Or with docker-compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Djtony707/TITAN.git && cd TITAN
cp .env.example .env     # Edit with your API keys
docker compose up -d
```

That's it. From zero to a running autonomous agent with a dashboard.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Djtony707/TITAN.git && cd TITAN
npm install
npm run build:ui          # Build the React frontend
npm run dev:gateway       # Start in dev mode with Mission Control v2
```

### First Contact

```bash
titan agent -m "Hello"                  # Terminal chat
titan agent -m "What's on my calendar?" # Uses tools automatically
```

Or open `http://localhost:48420` and use the WebChat panel. Same agent, nicer UI.

## What TITAN Does

TITAN is not a chatbot wrapper. It's a framework for building AI agents that take real actions. Here's what that looks like in practice:

**"Research competitors and draft a report"**
TITAN enters deliberation mode. It decomposes the task into subtasks, spawns a browser sub-agent to research each competitor in parallel, synthesizes findings, writes a structured report, and saves it to disk. You approve the plan before execution starts.

**"Monitor Upwork for Node.js contracts and send me the best ones"**
TITAN creates a recurring goal. Every cycle, it searches freelance platforms, scores matches against your profile, drafts proposals, and queues them for your review. The autopilot handles scheduling.

**"Set up a content pipeline for my blog"**
TITAN researches SEO keywords, generates outlines, writes drafts, and schedules publishing. Each step uses specialized tools — `web_search` for research, `content_outline` for structure, `content_publish` for output.

**"What did I spend on APIs this month?"**
TITAN queries the income tracker, pulls cost data from provider logs, runs the numbers in a sandbox Python script, and returns a summary with a chart.

**"Deploy this to my mini PC"**
TITAN SSHs into the target machine via the mesh network, pulls the latest code, builds the Docker container, and reports back. All through the `shell` tool with mesh routing.

**"Get better at everything while I sleep"**
TITAN runs self-improvement experiments overnight. It modifies its own prompts, evaluates the changes against a benchmark suite using LLM-as-judge scoring, and keeps only the improvements. It can even fine-tune its own local model on your GPU. You wake up to a smarter agent.

No custom code required for any of the above. TITAN ships with 100+ loaded skills exposing ~155 tools. When it needs a capability it doesn't have, it can generate a new skill on the fly.

## Autonomy System

TITAN's autonomy system is a complete self-directed execution framework. This isn't just tool calling — it's self-directed goal pursuit with reflection, delegation, and initiative.

### Reflection

Every N tool-call rounds, TITAN pauses and asks itself: "Am I making progress? Should I continue, change approach, or stop?" Uses the `fast` model alias for cheap, quick self-checks. Prevents runaway loops and wasted tokens.

### Sub-Agents

The `spawn_agent` tool delegates tasks to isolated sub-agents with constrained toolsets. Four templates:

| Template | Tools | Use Case |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `explorer` | Web search, fetch, browse | Research and information gathering |
| `coder` | Shell, filesystem, edit | Code generation and modification |
| `browser` | Browser pool, Stagehand | Interactive web automation |
| `analyst` | Memory, data analysis | Analysis and synthesis |

Max depth = 1 (no sub-sub-agents). Each sub-agent gets its own session and returns results to the parent.

### Orchestrator

When a task involves multiple independent subtasks, the orchestrator:

1. Analyzes the request for delegation potential
2. Breaks it into parallel and sequential assignments
3. Spawns sub-agents for each
4. Runs independent tasks in parallel, dependent tasks sequentially
5. Synthesizes all results into a unified response

### Goals

Persistent goals with subtasks, scheduling, budget tracking, and progress monitoring. Goals drive the autopilot system — each cycle picks the next actionable subtask.

```
You: "I want to grow my Twitter following to 10K"

TITAN creates a goal with subtasks:
  1. Analyze current posting patterns        [complete]
  2. Research trending topics in your niche   [complete]
  3. Draft 5 tweets for review               [in_progress]
  4. Schedule optimal posting times           [pending]
  5. Monitor engagement metrics weekly        [recurring]
```

Tools: `goal_create`, `goal_list`, `goal_update`, `goal_delete`

### Self-Initiative

After completing a goal subtask, TITAN checks for the next ready task. In autonomous mode, it starts working immediately. In supervised mode, it proposes the next action. Rate-limited to prevent runaway execution.

### Autonomy Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `autonomous` | Full auto — executes all tools, auto-triggers deliberation, self-initiates goal subtasks |
| `supervised` | Asks before dangerous operations, proposes next steps (default) |
| `locked` | Asks permission for every tool call |

```bash
titan config set autonomy.mode supervised
```

### Deliberative Reasoning

When TITAN detects an ambitious request, it enters a multi-stage loop:

1. **Analyze** — Examines the request from multiple angles using high thinking
2. **Plan** — Generates a structured, dependency-aware execution plan
3. **Approve** — Presents the plan for your review
4. **Execute** — Runs each step, reporting progress via WebSocket
5. **Adapt** — Re-analyzes and adjusts if a step fails

```bash
/plan figure out how to monetize this homelab     # Force deliberation
/plan status                                        # Check progress
/plan cancel                                        # Abort
```

---

## Self-Improvement

This is the big one. TITAN doesn't just run tasks — it **makes itself better at running tasks**. Autonomously. While you sleep.

Inspired by [Karpathy's autoresearch pattern](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch), TITAN runs experiments on itself: propose a change, evaluate it, keep it if it's better, discard it if it's not. Rinse, repeat, forever.

### How It Works

1. TITAN picks an improvement area (prompts, tool selection, response quality, error recovery)
2. Runs a **baseline eval** — sends test cases to itself, scores responses with an LLM-as-judge
3. Proposes a modification to the target prompt/config (via LLM-guided search/replace)
4. Runs the eval again with the change applied
5. **Keeps** the change if the score improved, **discards** it if it didn't
6. Logs everything to `~/.titan/self-improve/results/`

### Improvement Areas

| Area | What Gets Optimized | Eval Metric |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Prompts** | System prompt wording and structure | Response quality score (0-100) |
| **Tool Selection** | Tool descriptions and routing logic | Correct tool chosen (% accuracy) |
| **Response Quality** | Response style, conciseness, accuracy | User satisfaction proxy score |
| **Error Recovery** | Retry strategies, fallback behavior | Recovery success rate |

### Local Model Training

Got a GPU? TITAN can **fine-tune its own local models** using your conversation history. Two training pipelines are available:

| Pipeline | Model Name | Training Data | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Tool Router** | `titan-qwen` | Single-turn instruction → tool selection pairs | Fast tool routing for TITAN's brain/router |
| **Main Agent** | `titan-agent` | Multi-turn ChatML conversations with OpenAI function calling | Full agent behavior — reasoning, tool use, error recovery |

**Tool Router** training uses compact instruction/output pairs to teach the model which tool to call. **Main Agent** training uses 530+ multi-turn conversation examples covering tool calling, direct answers, error recovery, multi-step chains, and identity — all in OpenAI function calling format.

Both pipelines are fully configurable from Mission Control's Self-Improve panel:
- **Base model** (e.g., `unsloth/Qwen2.5-32B-bnb-4bit`)
- **LoRA rank** (8–128)
- **Learning rate** (1e-5 – 1e-3)
- **Epochs** (1–10)
- **Time budget** (5–120 minutes)
- **Max sequence length** (512–8192)

Training tools:

1. `train_prepare` — Extracts high-quality training data from session history
2. `train_start` — Launches LoRA fine-tuning via unsloth on your GPU (background process, budget-limited)
3. `train_status` — Monitor training progress (loss, epoch, ETA)
4. `train_deploy` — Converts to GGUF, imports to Ollama, optionally switches TITAN's active model

Works with any GPU that can run unsloth. Tested with Qwen 3.5 35B.

### Schedule & Config

Everything is configurable from Mission Control's Self-Improvement panel or `titan.json`:

```json
{
  "selfImprove": {
    "enabled": true,
    "runsPerDay": 4,
    "schedule": ["0 2 * * *", "0 8 * * *", "0 14 * * *", "0 20 * * *"],
    "budgetMinutes": 30,
    "areas": ["prompts", "tool-selection", "response-quality", "error-recovery"],
    "autoApply": true,
    "maxDailyBudgetMinutes": 120,
    "pauseOnWeekends": false
  }
}
```

Or let autopilot handle it — set `autopilot.mode: "self-improve"` and TITAN runs experiments on the configured schedule automatically.

### Tools

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `self_improve_start` | Launch an improvement session targeting a specific area |
| `self_improve_status` | Check current session progress |
| `self_improve_apply` | Apply successful experiment results to live config |
| `self_improve_history` | View history of all improvement sessions and outcomes |
| `train_prepare` | Curate training data from conversation history |
| `train_start` | Launch LoRA fine-tuning job on GPU |
| `train_status` | Monitor training progress |
| `train_deploy` | Convert model to GGUF and import to Ollama |

### Distributed Setup

TITAN supports split-machine deployments — run the gateway on a low-power node (e.g., Raspberry Pi 5) and route inference to a GPU machine (e.g., a desktop with an RTX GPU running Ollama). Configure via environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
# On your Pi 5 / Mini PC (gateway)
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://<gpu-machine-ip>:11434  # Points to GPU machine

# On your GPU PC
ollama serve  # Exposes models on the LAN
```

| **MiniMax** | OpenAI-compat | M2.7 (2.3T MoE, 200K ctx), M2.5, M1 |

**4 native providers** with full API integration. **32 OpenAI-compatible providers** through a unified adapter. All 36 support automatic failover with configurable fallback chains — if your primary model goes down, TITAN cascades to the next one automatically.

```bash
titan model --discover                              # Live-detect all available models
titan model --set anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
titan model --alias fast=openai/gpt-4o-mini         # Create shortcuts
```

Built-in aliases: `fast`, `smart`, `cheap`, `reasoning`, `local` — fully configurable.

## Voice (LiveKit WebRTC)

TITAN's real-time voice uses [LiveKit](https://livekit.io/) — a production-grade WebRTC platform that handles echo cancellation, NAT traversal, codec negotiation, and jitter buffering. No custom audio pipelines, no PCM-over-WebSocket hacks.

**How it works:**
1. Click "Start Voice" in Mission Control
2. TITAN fetches a scoped JWT token (`POST /api/livekit/token`)
3. Browser connects to a LiveKit room via WebRTC
4. LiveKit's agent worker bridges STT → TITAN's agent brain → TTS
5. You talk, TITAN responds — sub-second latency, full duplex

**Deployment options:**
- **LiveKit Cloud** — zero infrastructure, set `LIVEKIT_URL` / `LIVEKIT_API_KEY` / `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`
- **Self-hosted** — run `livekit-server` on your own hardware

The file-based voice tools (`generate_speech`, `transcribe_audio`) still work independently via the OpenAI API for offline use cases.

---

## Mesh Networking

Connect up to 5 machines so they share AI models and API keys. One machine has a GPU? The others can use its local models. One machine has an OpenAI key? Everyone benefits.

TITAN finds your other machines automatically via mDNS on your local network, or via Tailscale if they're remote.

### Quick Setup

**Machine 1** (your GPU desktop):
```bash
titan mesh --init         # Generates a secret: TITAN-a1b2-c3d4-e5f6
titan gateway
```

**Machine 2** (your laptop):
```bash
titan mesh --join "TITAN-a1b2-c3d4-e5f6"
titan gateway
```

Machine 2 discovers Machine 1 automatically. You approve the connection (or enable `--auto-approve`), and both machines now share all available models.

### How Routing Works

1. **Local first** — If your machine has the model, it runs locally
2. **Mesh fallback** — If not, TITAN checks connected peers
3. **Provider failover** — Last resort, tries other local providers

### Approval System

New peers are quarantined until approved. Manage from CLI or the Mesh dashboard panel:

```bash
titan mesh --pending                    # See who's waiting
titan mesh --approve <nodeId>           # Allow connection
titan mesh --reject <nodeId>            # Deny connection
titan mesh --revoke <nodeId>            # Disconnect an approved peer
titan mesh --auto-approve               # Trust all peers with your secret
```

Approved peers persist to `~/.titan/approved-peers.json` and reconnect automatically on restart.

### Remote Machines (Tailscale)

```json
{
  "mesh": {
    "enabled": true,
    "tailscale": true
  }
}
```

Or add static peers manually: `titan mesh --add "<peer-ip>:48420"`

---

## MCP Server Mode

TITAN can act as an **MCP server**, exposing all ~155 tools to other AI agents via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or any MCP client can connect and use TITAN's tools.

**HTTP transport** (runs on the gateway port):
```json
// titan.json
{ "mcp": { "server": { "enabled": true } } }
```
Then any MCP client can connect to `http://localhost:48420/mcp`.

**Stdio transport** (launch TITAN as a subprocess):
```json
// claude_desktop_config.json or .cursor/mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "titan": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["titan-agent", "mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Security: MCP server respects the same `security.deniedTools` and `security.allowedTools` config as the gateway.

---

## Sandbox Code Execution

When the LLM needs to run complex logic — loops, data processing, batch operations — it writes Python and executes it in an isolated Docker container. Tool calls from inside the sandbox route through a secure HTTP bridge back to TITAN.

```
Traditional approach: 50 individual tool calls x LLM round-trips = bloated context + slow
Sandbox approach:     1 Python script with a for-loop = fast, accurate, minimal tokens
```

The LLM writes code like this:
```python
from tools import web_search, read_file

results = []
for topic in ["AI agents", "LLM tools", "code sandbox"]:
    data = web_search(query=topic)
    results.append(data)

print(f"Found {len(results)} results")
```

**Security:** Containers run with `--cap-drop=ALL`, `--read-only`, `--security-opt=no-new-privileges`, memory/CPU limits, and session-token authenticated bridge. Dangerous tools (`shell`, `exec`, `process`) are blocked inside the sandbox.

```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "engine": "docker",
    "enabled": true,
    "timeoutMs": 60000,
    "memoryMB": 512,
    "deniedTools": ["shell", "exec", "code_exec", "process", "apply_patch"]
  }
}
```

**Alternative: NVIDIA OpenShell** — For NVIDIA GPU machines, set `"engine": "openshell"` to use K3s-based sandboxes with declarative YAML security policies. Requires `TITAN_NVIDIA=1`.

---

| **VRAM Management** | `vram_status`, `vram_acquire`, `vram_release` (auto-swap models for GPU services) |

### Tool Search — Compact Mode

TITAN doesn't dump all 155 tool schemas into every LLM call. It sends only 8 core tools plus `tool_search`. When the LLM needs a capability, it calls `tool_search("email")` and gets the relevant tools added dynamically.

```
Before: 155 tools x ~50 tokens each = ~7,750 input tokens
After:  10 core tools + tool_search  = ~700 input tokens (88% reduction)
```

Works with all 35 providers. Especially beneficial for smaller local models where context window is precious.

## Custom Skills

Create new tools in seconds. Use the scaffolding CLI or drop files into `~/.titan/skills/`:

### Scaffold a Skill (Recommended)

```bash
# Generate a full skill project with template, metadata, and tests
titan create-skill my_tool --format ts

# Or use the long form
titan skills --scaffold --name my_tool --format js --description "Fetches data" --author "Your Name"

# Test your skill
titan skills --test my_tool
```

This creates `~/.titan/skills/my_tool/` with the skill source, `SKILL.md` metadata, and a test file.

### YAML (Easiest)

```yaml
# ~/.titan/skills/word_count.yaml
name: word_count
description: Count words, lines, and characters in a file
parameters:
  filePath:
    type: string
    description: Path to the file
    required: true
script: |
  const fs = require('fs');
  const content = fs.readFileSync(args.filePath, 'utf-8');
  const lines = content.split('\n').length;
  const words = content.split(/\s+/).filter(Boolean).length;
  return 'Lines: ' + lines + ', Words: ' + words + ', Characters: ' + content.length;
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
// ~/.titan/skills/hello.js
export default {
  name: 'hello',
  description: 'Greet someone by name',
  parameters: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      name: { type: 'string', description: 'Name to greet' }
    },
    required: ['name']
  },
  execute: async (args) => `Hello, ${args.name}!`
};
```

### AI-Generated

```bash
titan skills --create "a tool that converts CSV files to JSON"
```

TITAN writes, compiles, and hot-loads the skill instantly.

## Security

Defense-in-depth, not "we'll add auth later."

| Layer | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Prompt Injection Shield** | Two-layer detection — heuristic engine + keyword density analysis |
| **DM Pairing** | New senders quarantined until approved |
| **Sandbox** | Docker isolation with `--cap-drop=ALL`, read-only filesystem, memory limits |
| **Secrets Vault** | AES-256-GCM encrypted credential store with PBKDF2 key derivation |
| **Audit Log** | HMAC-SHA256 chained tamper-evident JSONL trail |
| **E2E Encryption** | AES-256-GCM per-session encryption, keys held in memory only |
| **Tool Allowlists** | Configurable per-agent tool permissions |
| **Network Allowlists** | Configurable outbound connection boundaries |
| **Autonomy Gates** | Risk classification with human-in-the-loop approval |

---

## Memory Systems

| System | Storage | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Episodic** | `~/.titan/titan-data.json` | Conversation history per session |
| **Learning** | `~/.titan/knowledge.json` | Tool success/failure rates, error patterns, resolutions |
| **Relationship** | `~/.titan/profile.json` | User preferences, work context, personal continuity |
| **Temporal Graph** | `~/.titan/graph.json` | Entities, episodes, relationships — searchable across time |

The temporal graph is pure TypeScript — no Neo4j, no Docker, no external services. Entities are extracted from conversations automatically, linked with timestamps, and injected into every system prompt.

## Roadmap

### Current (v2026.10.x)

- **v2026.10.45**: **MiniMax M2.7 + Autopilot Dry-Run** — New MiniMax provider (M2.7, 2.3T MoE, 200K context, provider #32). Community PR: autopilot dry-run mode by @sastarogers. 36 providers, 4,329 tests.
- **v2026.10.43**: **VRAM Orchestrator** — Automatic GPU VRAM management for RTX 5090. Monitors GPU via nvidia-smi, tracks Ollama model loads, auto-swaps to smaller models when GPU services need memory. Time-bounded leases with auto-expiry, async mutex for serialization, emergency OOM unload. 3 agent tools, 4 API endpoints, config schema.
- **v2026.10.42**: **NVIDIA GPU Skills** — cuOpt v26.02 async VRP optimization (tested live, 74ms solve), AI-Q deep research via Nemotron Super NIM API, OpenShell K3s sandbox engine. NVIDIA skill loader gated behind `TITAN_NVIDIA=1`. Voice mic leak fix. 6 TypeScript fixes.
- **v2026.10.41**: **Hotfix** — Tool visibility fix (security.allowedTools default), OpenAI-compat keepModelPrefix bug, voice system prompt rewrite, voice core tools, voice model override, HA debug logging.
- **v2026.10.40**: **9 New Skills** — Structured output, workflow engine, social scheduler, agent handoff, event triggers, knowledge base, eval framework, approval gates, A2A protocol. 2 critical security fixes. 4,329 tests across 135 files.
- **v2026.10.39**: **Security Release** — Resolved all 23 Dependabot alerts, 0 vulnerabilities.
- **v2026.10.28**: **Bug Fixes** — Vector search circular dependency fixed (`initVectors` now calls Ollama `/api/embed` directly instead of `embed()` which was gated on `available=false` during init, causing RAG to never initialize). ActiveLearning no-op fixed (no longer records "use X instead of X" when same tool succeeds on retry). ESLint prefer-const fix.
- **v2026.10.27**: **System Prompt Architecture Overhaul** — Complete redesign of how TITAN instructs AI models to use tools reliably. Tool Execution rules now appear first in the system prompt (before identity/capabilities). ReAct loop (Reason→Act→Observe) taught to every model. MUST/NEVER directives and negative examples (wrong vs. right behavior) burn in correct tool-call patterns. Task-aware dynamic injection appends `[TASK ENFORCEMENT]` blocks for file-write, research, and shell tasks detected in the message. API-level `tool_choice: "required"` added for OpenAI/Ollama and `tool_choice: {type: "any"}` for Anthropic on enforced first rounds. Ollama cloud prompt compression fixed — tool enforcement rules now survive compression (limit raised 2000→3500 chars). All 11 sub-agent templates (Explorer, Coder, Browser, Analyst, Researcher, Reporter, Fact Checker, Dev Debugger, Dev Tester, Dev Reviewer, Dev Architect) rewritten with tool-specific guidance, MUST rules, and output format requirements. New `agent.forceToolUse` config flag.
- **v2026.10.26**: **Live Training Feed** — Real-time SSE streaming of training progress in Self-Improvement panel, incremental training data writes (data survives tool timeouts), cloud-assisted training pipeline
- **v2026.10.22**: **Voice System Hardening** — 24 bug fixes across voice, gateway, and agent core. VoiceOverlay rewrite (stale closure fixes, AbortController cleanup, session continuity, emotion tag stripping). FluidOrb canvas rewrite (single animation loop, no 60fps teardown). Gateway SSE leak fix, TTS health probe fix, Ollama context 8K→16K, internal health monitor (Ollama/TTS/memory watchdog), fetchWithRetry timeout, systemd service unit, log rotation. 91 loaded skills, ~155 tools, 3,839 tests across 123 files.
- **v2026.10.21**: **Dual Training Pipelines** — Tool Router (single-turn tool selection) and Main Agent (multi-turn ChatML with OpenAI function calling) training modes. Self-Improve panel training type selector with fully customizable hyperparameters (base model, LoRA rank, learning rate, epochs, time budget, max sequence length). Training data generation, model deployment, and benchmarking from the UI. Ollama provider context management fix (prevents context over-allocation). New API endpoints: generate-data, deploy, type-filtered results.
- **v2026.10.20**: **Autonomous Self-Improvement** — TITAN experiments on its own prompts, tool selection, response quality, and error recovery using LLM-as-judge evaluation. LoRA fine-tuning pipeline (unsloth → GGUF → Ollama) for local model training on GPU. Configurable schedule (1–12 runs/day), budget caps, auto-apply, weekend pause. Mission Control Self-Improvement panel. Autopilot `self-improve` mode. 8 new tools, 149 total tools, 91 skills, 3,839 tests across 123 files.
- **v2026.10.17**: CapSolver CAPTCHA solving, direct form-fill API, deferred button clicks, React-compatible form automation
- **v2026.10.10**: Integrations panel (12 provider API keys + Google OAuth), Workflows panel (Goals, Cron, Recipes, Autopilot), autonomous persona, research pipeline with autoresearch, TopFacts context plugin, checkpoint/resume, 17 admin panels, 117 tools, 82 skills, 3,691 tests across 114 files
- **v2026.10.4**: Onboarding wizard, system_info tool, tool discovery fix, polished Mission Control
- **v2026.10.0**: Mission Control v2 — React 19 SPA with ChatGPT-style chat, distributed setup support, voice health endpoint, THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md
- **v2026.9.6**: Version sync fix, mini PC deployment update
- **v2026.9.5**: Visual Workflow Builder — drag-and-drop recipe editor, YAML export/import, node-graph canvas, 7 API endpoints
- **v2026.9.4**: One-Line Install, Cloud Deploy (Railway/Render/Replit), optimized Dockerfile
- **v2026.9.2**: Team Mode with RBAC — 4 roles, invite system, per-role tool permissions, 14 API endpoints
- **v2026.9.1**: Plugin SDK + Skill Scaffolding — CLI templates for JS/TS/YAML skill development
